[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kisp/ksquant2.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kisp/ksquant2)


I recommend downloading the pre-compiled version for OSX:
http://sprotte.org/downloads/ksquant2-osx-0-1-10-tgz.html

or for windows:
http://sprotte.org/downloads/ksquant2-win-0-1-10-zip.html

Then it can be installed as a normal PWGL user-library in
$HOME/PWGL-User/User-library or the corresponding place on
windows. Please make sure that after downloading and extracting the
archive the folder is named "ksquant2".

Bugs can be browsed and reported here:
https://github.com/kisp/ksquant2/issues

* changes in 0.1.10 relative to 0.1.9:
  * bugfix: for voices containing only a rest
  * new feature: support for windows

* changes in 0.1.9 relative to 0.1.8:
  * bugfix: the correct way to indicate a rest is e.g. (6.875 :REST T)
            the keyword is :REST, not :RESTP
  * bugfix: It was not possible to start with a rest, i.e. (0.0 :REST T)
            did not work correctly
