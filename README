I recommend downloading the pre-compiled version for OSX:
http://sprotte.org/ksquant2-0.1.8.tgz

Then it can be installed as a normal PWGL user-library in $HOME/PWGL-User/User-library.

* changes in 0.1.9 relative to 0.1.8:
** bugfix: the correct way to indicate a rest is e.g. (6.875 :REST T)
   	   the keyword is :REST, not :RESTP
** bugfix: It was not possible to start with a rest, i.e. (0.0 :REST T)
   	   did not work correctly
